    <string name="desc">Galas are sophisticated parties that let people come dressed up, enjoy an evening of food and get-together, dancing, and more. Nonprofit fundraising galas are no different, with the intention varying from spreading awareness to acquiring donors to raising funds for a program. Todayâ€™s nonprofit galas can range from high-end Met Gala-type events to an online fundraiser where your guests order food and dress up in their own homes.</string>
